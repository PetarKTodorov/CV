            <p>Description:</p>
            <p>This resposive site is my first non-educational project. It aims to present me in the best light to my
                future employers, even though it is just a static site.
                In it I am telling about myself, what I am interested in, what I am good at, what technologies and
                programming languages I am skilful at, as well as what is my education, professional experience, and
                other things.
            </p>
