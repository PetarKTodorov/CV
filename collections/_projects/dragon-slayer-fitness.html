            <p>Description:</p>
            <p>In this project users can create their own fitness program with exercises they have choosen and monitor
                their proper implementation. Users can also record in their own food diary what and when they have
                eaten, thus keeping a close watch on their calories. The site also has a built-in calculator to count
                the calories needed per day to achieve the desired effect. Last but not least, site users can keep an
                eye on the muscular growth of each part of their body determining by themselves time periods of
                these checks. The administrative part is divided into three parts: a Food Administrator who has the
                authority to perform CRUD operations on food; an Exercise Administrator who has the authority to
                perform CRUD operations on exercises and a Head Administrator who can ban users and grant administrative
                rights to users.</p>
